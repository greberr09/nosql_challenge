# nosql_challenge

Module 12 challenge involves the nosql database mongo_db and the Python connection pymongo.

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. For this challenge, the challenge author has been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
